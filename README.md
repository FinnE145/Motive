# Motive - Notes, Writing, & Productivity

The perfect all-in-one app for students and professionals looking to get things done, created by a student to fill the gaps left by other apps and bring together essential functionality. True handwriting-centric notes and diagramming features make it easy to understand material better, seamlessly mix media types, and quietly leverage machine learning to make notes neat, fluid, and easily searchable. Simple-yet-powerful document editing provides all the features you expect from the formats you know, with a refreshed interface and unparalleled ease of use. A suite of tracking and scheduling features means you'll always be there on time, know what you need to get done, or can keep an eye on your habits.
